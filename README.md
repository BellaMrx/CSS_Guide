## 1.1. History of CSS
 The inventors of CSS are Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. CSS Level 1 Recommendation was published in 1996, the version was mainly about the design of Wch Fonts and Color.
 The next version, CSS Level 2, was published in 1998. Since there were many inconsistencies, because different web browsers do not implement many things correctly, this version was revised in 2002. It took until 2011 for CSS 2.1.to be released. In this version, the positioning of elements was included.
 The third version of CSS, has been in the works since 2000, there was no longer a single specification used, but the various features were with CSS3 aufgeilt into modules. Each module adds new capabilities and extends CSS 2.1, keeping everything backward compatible.
 Today, CSS no longer has a version number and consists of numerous modules. CSS3 is actually just a term for the modules added after 2.1.. However, the individual modules still have version numbers. 

 An overview of all modules in progress, can be found at [W3C:CSS current work](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work.en.html).
 All other modules can be found at [W3C:CSS Snapshot 2022](http://w3.org/TR/CSS/).
